A poetic and painterly film that has been described as \a collage of dreams\. The film was shot without a script, but Garrel had already thought up the eventual title (\the scar inside\). This title was an obsession for him, every shot had to be an expression of \the scar inside\. Apart from Garrel himself and actor Pierre Clementi, Garrel\s former partner Nico, member of the legendary Velvet Underground, played a role in the film. Another important role was for the landscape. Garrel, 23 when he made the film, was compared with Jean Vigo because of his age and talent. La cicatrice interieure even led Claude Mauriac to call him the Rimbaud of film.

3085, La Mia Classe, 0, Drama, Documentary, en, The ostensibly simple story of a sympathetic veteran teacher giving Italian lessons to a weekly class of diverse immigrants is given infinitely more depth and complexity by the manner in which director Daniele Gaglianone renders his story. Blurring the lines between fact and fiction, truth and artifice, and between documentary and drama, Gaglianone has created a film within a film. You see the apparent artifice of Gaglianone\s crew using professionals, including the noted film actor Valerio Mastandrea as the teacher, interlinked with √¢¬Ä¬òreal\ immigrant protagonists, studying the language to improve their chances of employment and of gaining a permanent residence permit. Thus in the course of the lessons there is simultaneously the painful and upsetting relation of the students\ personal stories but also humour, as they interact and share their humanity, bridging cultural differences, united in their striving to make a better life for themselves.

It is at the same time a chronicle of the liberation and independence of the former African colonies, portraying these peoples as the new protagonists of the world stage, holding up Marxism as their salvation, and suggesting that their innocent ferocity will be the new religion of the era. Guareschi\s part, by contrast, constitutes a defense of Western civilization and a word of hope, couched in traditional Christian terms, for man\s future., 0.2125410000, /plVkFbmW6898n1EGz6WCw1Uv1LQ.jpg, TF1 Films Production ,Lumiere Motion Picture Company, 1963-01-01, 104, 7.80000, 4

4786, Ya Shagayu po Moskve, 0, Romance, Comedy, ru, I Am Walking Along Moscow aka Ya Shagayu Po Moskve (1963) is a charming lyrical comedy directed by Georgi Daneliya in 1963 that was nominated for Golden Palm at Cannes Film Festival. Daneliya proved that it is possible to create a masterpiece in the most difficult genre of romantic comedy. Made by the team of young and incredibly talented artists that besides Daneliya included writer/poet Gennady Shpalikov, composer Andrei Petrov, and cinematographer Vadim Yusov (who had made four films with Andrei Tarkovski), and the dream cast of the talented actors even in the smaller cameos, I Am Walking Along Moscow keeps walking victoriously through the decades remaining deservingly one of the best and most beloved Russian comedies and simply one of the best Russian movies ever made. Funny and gentle, dreamy and humorous, romantic and realistic, the film is blessed with the eternal youth and will always take to the walk on the streets of Moscow new generations of the grateful viewers., 2.0947770000, /4FAeGHpHLvVdOgfxzz7brkRKiGx.jpg, Wunderbar Films,Grass Root Film Company, 1963-01-01, 78, 7.00000, 12
